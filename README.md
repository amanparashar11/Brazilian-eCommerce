This work illustrate the complete understanding of extraction, refining, and delivering insights from the Olist dataset.
It begins by understanding the entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinality of the provided dataset, which leads us to design the ER diagram 
and provide DDL statements for the tables. 
The later half identifies the issues with records and normalise the schema, illustrated with an updated ER diagram. 
Finally, complex SQL queries, their dplyr equivalents, and visualisations are provided to answer critical business questions.

The datasets are located at:
